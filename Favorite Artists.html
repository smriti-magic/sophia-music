  <h1>Why I like the artists</h1>
  <h1>1. Avril Lavigne</h1>
    <p>I like Avril Lavigne because I like songs from the 1980s to 2010. Avril Lavigne had some big hits in the 2000s. My favorite song from Avril Lavigne is Girlfriend. I like all songs by Avril Lavigne though first would be Girlfriend then Smile.</p>

  <h1>2.Alvaro Soler</h1>
    <p>I've heard one song from Alvaro Soler: Sofia but I really like it and it's in Spanish and makes much better in Spanish than Eniglish to me.<p>
