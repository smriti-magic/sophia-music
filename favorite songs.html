    <h2>Here's to never growing up</h2>
    <p>Here's to never growing up from Avril Lavigne came out in 2013. here's to never growing up is one of my favorite songs because no one wants to grow up unless your a kid who really wants to be an adult. Like the song title Here's to never growing up is about Avril Lavigne singing about that she still lives a life like teenagers.</p>

   <p>What you don't know is that I <strong>LOVE THE 80's!</strong> One of my favorite songs from the 80's is Uptown girl from Billy Joel. Uptown girl came out in 1983. Uptown girl is the only song from Billy Joel that I know. Uptown girl is about Billy Joel singing about how he likes with girl from uptown and he's from downtown. If you didn't know Olivia Rodrigo's Deja Vu has a small part of Billy Joel's Uptwon girl in it. Later Olivia Rodrigo join Billy Joel in a concert singing Deja Vu and Uptown girl.</p>

   <h4>This is Toni Basil the person who sang Hey Mickey</h4>
   <p>Hey Mickey came out in 1981. Hey Mickey by Toni Basil not Baby Tate is about a girl who really like this guy. You might have heard the song Hey, Mickey! By Baby Tate but if you don't know Hey Mickey was first made by Toni Basil in 1981.</p>

    <h2>Smile</h2>
    <p>Lastly there is Smile by Avril Lavigne is my 4th favorite song. I like other songs by Avril Lavigne, and one of my favorite songs is Smile from Avril Lavigne.

    <Li>Just somebody that I used to know (Gotye)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Now I should also tell you all about the other songs because I'm just leaving you hanging</p>
  <h2>Girlfriend</h2>
  <p> the song girldfriend is about this girl who likes this guy but the guy has a girlfriend. Girlfriend was the first song Avril Lavigne that I heard.</p>
  <h2>Just somebody that I used to know</h2>
  <p>You might have seen the brain meme with some of the song in it. Just sombody that I used to know is about confusion you can have after a broken relationship, and the way you can feel emotionally quite up and down. I always have that song stuck in my head a lot</p>
