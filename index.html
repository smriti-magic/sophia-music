  <p>Since I was little I've <strong>ALWAYS</strong> loved music. One of my favorite artist's has always been Avril Lavigne. 
    I always change my mind about who's my favorite artist's and today it's Avril Lavigne. Latly I have loved Avril Lavigne's music. 
    One day I hope to have my own album just not for a while.</p>
