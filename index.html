  <h2>Here's to never growing up</h2>
  <p>Here's to never growing up from Avril Lavigne came out in 2013. here's to never growing up is one of my favorite songs because no one wants to grow up unless your a kid who really wants to be an adult. Like the song title Here's to never growing up is about Avril Lavigne singing about that she still lives a life like teenagers.</p>

  <h2>Uptown girl</h2>
  <p>What you don't know is that I <strong>LOVE THE 80's!</strong> One of my favorite songs from the 80's is Uptown girl from Billy Joel. Uptown girl came out in 1983. Uptown girl is the only song from Billy Joel that I know. Uptown girl is about Billy Joel singing about how he likes with girl from uptown and he's from downtown. If you didn't know Olivia Rodrigo's Deja Vu has a small part of Billy Joel's Uptwon girl in it. Later Olivia Rodrigo join Billy Joel in a concert singing Deja Vu and Uptown girl.</p>
